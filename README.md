# Business Site


Assignment was to create a business site where you could fill in a form and read FAQs with an accordion function about the site, combined with a header of a video or hero image, where I chose a video to loop.  

## The problem

I started by building the HTML skeleton, with the form and after that went on to css. However, I finished the accordion last after all the css. But that was the first thing to do after setting up a mockup in Figma, which was helpful. Even if it doesnt look exactly like I made it there. 

One thing I found when looking at the mobile version in mobile, was that the play button showed up, but this was fxed by removing "controls" in the video tag after investigating what that actually did. 

I added some javaScript, the accordion and also when you enter your name in the form and press enter, a message shows up above it with the name that you wrote, which I am proud of making work even if I toally just copied the function from the livesession. But doing so makes me see and somewhat understand how javaScript works, even if it is a long way to go to grasp it. 

I feel there might be a few lines too many of css but on the othr hand I also feel they kinda need to be there to make it work. Not sure how many lines are "appropriate". I think that this is someting I will learn along the way. 

I also linked to my previous project from week 2, Daily Space,  as I continued on the same theme, "Give us Space". Which was just a fun little thing to do. 

A lot of googling has been done, that's for sure!
